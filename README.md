# DontForget
Android App Final Assignment, Written in Kotlin

  During the last phase of the project I spend a lot of time working with the MySQL database as it has a lot of limitations in the way that data can be handled and 
although I’m happy with the way I have stored the data to the database. For the majority of the part I have managed to achieve all the project goals in terms of storing a 
list of reminders but I did not manage to finish the part of to actually notify the user of the reminder date coming up (ran out of time) but I still managed to implement 
all the other features I wanted as plan (for the most part). In the end I changed the way the main interface worked because I did not have enough time to learn the adding 
and selecting from the view but going forward with this project I would most definitely add that back. I learned a lot of new things working on this project especially 
working with MySQL and kotlin on top of that learning to confirmation & input pop up boxes. 
  To continue this project forward my next steps would be to clean up the UI even more because it still doesn’t quite sit properly with this I would add the ScrollView back 
and implement more features like double tap to go into Reminder View rather than pressing edit to lookup and go to that view before editing. I would also improve some of 
the MySQL functions specially in the code that handles updating the edit.
